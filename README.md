# Smuggler
Join me in the process of learning game hacking


## About
Smuggler is currently a simple LoadLibraryA dll injector designed with the goal of evolving it into becoming an actual "good" tool for gamehacking.

I am new to c++ and gamehacking and I plan to evolve this project over time while learning more about the WINAPI and memory.

I will be heavily commenting this repository in order to allow for begginners like myself to get a better bearing of what is actually going on in the program instead of just giving you the file and telling you it works.


## Original Commit - 12/11/21
Smuggler is currently a very basic LoadLibraryA injector that also hooks IsDebuggerPresent and sets it to return false to defeat very basic anti-debugging techniques.
